               KEYS and DATA must be proper lists of equal length.~@
               ALIST can be any object, but is typically an association~@
               list.  This function adds entries to the front of ALIST.~@
               An entry is created as a CONS cell where the CAR is an~@
               element of KEYS and the CDR is the corresponding element~@
               of DATA.  If ALIST is a valid association list, then this~@
               function returns a valid association list with containing~@
               the additional entries.  The order of the additional entries~@
               should not be relied upon.  The default value for ALIST~@
               is the empty list.~@
               ~@
               If KEYS and DATA are both circular lists, then this function~@
               will not terminate.  Otherwise, if either KEYS or DATA is~@
               a dotted list or an atom, then an error of type TYPE-ERROR~@
               is signaled.  If  KEYS and DATA are both proper lists, but~@
               with different lengths, then an error is signaled."))
