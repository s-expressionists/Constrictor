               of applying KEY to an element of LIST-2 in that order.~@
               For some element E1 of LIST-1, if for some element E2 of~@
               LIST-2, the test is satisfied, then E1 is excluded from~@
               the return value of this function.  Otherwise, i.e., if~@

               When possible, the list structure of LIST-1 is destructively~@

               it is not also a member of LIST-2, with respect to the~@
